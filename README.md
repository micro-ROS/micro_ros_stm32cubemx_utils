## Middlewares available

This package support the usage of micro-ROS on top of two different middlewares:
- [eProsima Micro XRCE-DDS](https://micro-xrce-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/): the default micro-ROS middleware.
- [embeddedRTPS](https://github.com/embedded-software-laboratory/embeddedRTPS): an experimental implementation of a RTPS middleware compatible with ROS 2. **Instructions on how to use it available [here](./embeddedrtps.md).**

## Using this package with STM32CubeMX

1. Clone this repository in your STM32CubeMX project folder. A sample project can be generated with the provided `sample_project.ioc`.
2. Make sure that your STM32CubeMX project is using a `Makefile` toolchain under `Project Manager -> Project`
3. Make sure that if you are using FreeRTOS, the micro-ROS task **has more than 10 kB of stack**: [Detail](.images/Set_freertos_stack.jpg)
4. Configure the transport interface on the STM32CubeMX project, check the [Transport configuration](#Transport-configuration) section for instructions on the custom transports provided.
5. Modify the generated `Makefile` to include the following code **before the `build the application` section**:

   <!-- # Removing heap4 manager while being polite with STM32CubeMX
   TMPVAR := $(C_SOURCES)
   C_SOURCES := $(filter-out Middlewares/Third_Party/FreeRTOS/Source/portable/MemMang/heap_4.c, $(TMPVAR)) -->

   ```makefile
   #######################################
   # micro-ROS addons
   #######################################
   LDFLAGS += micro_ros_stm32cubemx_utils/microros_static_library/libmicroros/libmicroros.a
   C_INCLUDES += -Imicro_ros_stm32cubemx_utils/microros_static_library/libmicroros/microros_include

   # Add micro-ROS utils
   C_SOURCES += micro_ros_stm32cubemx_utils/extra_sources/custom_memory_manager.c
   C_SOURCES += micro_ros_stm32cubemx_utils/extra_sources/microros_allocators.c
   C_SOURCES += micro_ros_stm32cubemx_utils/extra_sources/microros_time.c

   # Set here the custom transport implementation
   C_SOURCES += micro_ros_stm32cubemx_utils/extra_sources/microros_transports/dma_transport.c

   print_cflags:
      @echo $(CFLAGS)
   ```

6. Execute the static library generation tool. Compiler flags will retrieved automatically from your `Makefile` and user will be prompted to check if they are correct.


   ```bash
   docker pull microros/micro_ros_static_library_builder:humble
   docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/project --env MICROROS_LIBRARY_FOLDER=micro_ros_stm32cubemx_utils/microros_static_library microros/micro_ros_static_library_builder:humble
   ```

1. Modify your `main.c` to use micro-ROS. An example application can be found in `sample_main.c`.
2. Continue your usual workflow building your project and flashing the binary:

   ```bash
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

## Using this package with STM32CubeIDE

micro-ROS can be used with SMT32CubeIDE following these steps:

1. Clone this repository in your STM32CubeIDE project folder
2. Go to `Project -> Settings -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Build Steps Tab` and in `Pre-build steps` add:

   ```bash
   docker pull microros/micro_ros_static_library_builder:humble && docker run --rm -v ${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}}:/project --env MICROROS_LIBRARY_FOLDER=micro_ros_stm32cubemx_utils/microros_static_library_ide microros/micro_ros_static_library_builder:humble
   ```

3. Add micro-ROS include directory. In `Project -> Settings -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings Tab -> MCU GCC Compiler -> Include paths` add `micro_ros_stm32cubemx_utils/microros_static_library_ide/libmicroros/include`
4. Add the micro-ROS precompiled library. In `Project -> Settings -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> MCU GCC Linker -> Libraries`
      - add `<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO>/micro_ros_stm32cubemx_utils/microros_static_library_ide/libmicroros` in `Library search path (-L)`
      - add `microros` in `Libraries (-l)`
5. Add the following source code files to your project, dragging them to source folder:
      - `extra_sources/microros_time.c`
      - `extra_sources/microros_allocators.c`
      - `extra_sources/custom_memory_manager.c`
      - `extra_sources/microros_transports/dma_transport.c` or your transport selection.
6. Make sure that if you are using FreeRTOS, the micro-ROS task **has more than 10 kB of stack**: [Detail](.images/Set_freertos_stack.jpg)
7. Configure the transport interface on the STM32CubeMX project, check the [Transport configuration](#Transport-configuration) section for instructions on the custom transports provided.
8. Build and run your project
## Transport configuration

Available transport for this platform are:
### U(S)ART with DMA

Steps to configure:
   - Enable U(S)ART in your STM32CubeMX
   - For the selected USART, enable DMA for Tx and Rx under `DMA Settings`
   - Set the DMA priotity to `Very High` for Tx and Rx
   - Set the DMA mode to `Circular` for Rx: [Detail](.images/Set_UART_DMA1.jpg)
   - For the selected, enable `global interrupt` under `NVIC Settings`: [Detail](.images/Set_UART_DMA_2.jpg)

### U(S)ART with Interrupts

Steps to configure:
   - Enable U(S)ART in your STM32CubeMX
   - For the selected USART, enable `global interrupt` under `NVIC Settings`: [Detail](.images/Set_UART_IT.jpg)

### USB CDC

Steps to configure:
   - Enable the USB in your STM32CubeMX `Connectivity` tab.
   - Select the `Communication Device Class (Virtual Port Com)` mode on the `Middleware -> USB_DEVICE` configuration.

      **Note: The micro-ROS transport will override the autogenerated `USB_DEVICE/App/usbd_cdc_if.c` methods.**

## Customizing the micro-ROS library

All the micro-ROS configuration can be done in `colcon.meta` file before step 3. You can find detailed information about how to tune the static memory usage of the library in the [Middleware Configuration tutorial](https://micro.ros.org/docs/tutorials/advanced/microxrcedds_rmw_configuration/).
## Adding custom packages

Note that folders added to `microros_static_library/library_generation/extra_packages/` and entries added to `/microros_static_library/library_generation/extra_packages/extra_packages.repos` will be taken into account by this build system.
